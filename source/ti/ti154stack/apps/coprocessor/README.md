TI 15.4-Stack Coprocessor Example
============================

Example Summary
---------------

The coprocessor example application demonstrates how to implement a Media Access Control (MAC) coprocessor device designed to work with a host processor in a two-chip scenario. The coprocessor provides an interface to the TI 15.4-Stack protocol stack with full-function MAC capability through a serial interface. Through this interface the application, running on the host, allows for the addition of TI 15.4-Stack wireless functionality to systems that are not suited to single-chip solutions.

The example applications in TI 15.4-Stack are developed for the CC13x2 Launchpad platform. In addition, the Linux example applications for the external host (AM335x + MAC Coprocessor) are located in the [**TI 15.4-Stack Gateway SDK**](http://www.ti.com/tool/ti-15.4-stack-gateway-linux-sdk).

> The project names for CC1352 and CC2652 platforms are referred to as CC13x2 or CC26X2. Replace X with either **1** or **5** depending on the specific wireless MCU being used.

> Note that this also includes the CC1352P-X boards, where the X represents which board subset is used, and the power amplification range.


> See `ti_154stack_features.h` for the default application features that are enabled.

Peripherals Exercised
---------------------

> To trigger various events, buttons can be used as well as the configurable user interface.
> The Example Usage section of this document explains how to use the user interface, although both the button presses and the CUI perform the
> same actions.

* `CONFIG_UART_TX` `CONFIG_UART_RX` - UART transmit and receive lines available through the backchannel CC13x2 Launchpad USB connection. This is used as the serial connection to the host processor.

Resources & Jumper Settings
---------------------------
The following hardware is required to run TI 15.4-Stack Out of Box (OOB) example applications:
* Two [**CC13x2 Launchpad development kits**](http://www.ti.com/tool/launchxl-cc1352r1) or two [**CC26x2 Launchpad development kits**](http://www.ti.com/tool/launchxl-cc26x2r1)

> If you're using an IDE (such as CCS or IAR), please refer to `Board.html` in
your project directory for resources used and board-specific jumper settings.
Otherwise, you can find `Board.html` in the directory
&lt;SDK_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/source/ti/boards/&lt;BOARD&gt;.

For an in-depth overview of the TI 15.4-Stack application, please refer to the TI 15.4-Stack User Guide at
`<SDK_ROOT>/docs/ti154stack/html/ti154stack/application-overview.html#application-overview`).


Example Usage
-------------
This example project implements a coprocessor device and as such does not directly provide a user interface.
After flashing the coprocessor application to the target device, the host collector application will output information
regarding the status of the coprocessor.

Analyzing Network Traffic
-------------------------

TI 15.4-Stack provides the means to analyze over-the-air traffic by including a packet sniffer firmware image. With an additional CC13x2 Launchpad, users can set up a packet sniffer with the software provided in the SDK. More information about this can be found in the TI 15.4-Stack documentation under **Packet Sniffer**.


Project Configuration
--------------------------

> SysConfig generated files are dynamically generated upon build, and any manual changes to them will be overwritten.

### Multi-Page NV Configuration

By default, this project is configured to use four pages of NV. A maximum of five NV pages are supported. In order to modify the NV pages, update the following:
* `NVOCMP_NVPAGES=4` in the project-specific .opt file
* `NVOCMP_NVPAGES=4` in the linker command file
* SysConfig NVS module:
   * Set Region Size based on the formula `NVOCMP_NVPAGES * 0x2000`
   * Set Region Base based on the formula `0x56000 - (NVOCMP_NVPAGES * 0x2000)`

A detailed description of the application architecture can be found within the TI 15.4-Stack Coprocessor Interface Guide
within the [**TI 15.4-Stack Gateway SDK**](http://www.ti.com/tool/ti-15.4-stack-gateway-linux-sdk) installation.
&lt;LINUX_SDK_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/docs/TI-15.4 Stack_CoP_Interface_Guide.pdf.

An overview of the application can be found in your installation within the
TI-15.4 Stack Getting Started Guide's Application Overview section.

> For IAR users: When using the CC13x2SDK, the TI XDS110v3 USB Emulator must
be selected. For the CC13x2_LAUNCHXL, select TI XDS110 Emulator. In both cases,
select the cJTAG interface.

### Building for CC2652P

Note that to build the coprocessor for the CC2652P, you will need to use the CC1352P-4 coprocessor project. Additionally,
you will need to manually enable the `COPROCESSOR_CC2652P` symbol for the build. You can do this by removing the `x` in
front of the definition of this symbol in the `application/defines/coprocessor.opts` file.
