This is a hidden parameter that locks the project and frequency band for SDK \
examples. It also locks the security level in SM projects. It is set to true \
in each example's .syscfg file.
\n\
__Default__: False (unchecked)
`

This is a hidden parameter that controls whether the stack module contributes \
libraries to the generated linker command file.

    longDescription: `
The software development kit (SDK) provides example applications for the TI \
15.4-Stack developed for the CC13x2 and CC26x2 platforms.
\n\
__Default__: The project type selected in this project is automatically  \
configured based on the example. Please see the other examples provided in \
the SDK if another project is desired.
\n\
__Note__: For more information on the type of example projects available, \
refer to the \
[Example Applications](/ti154stack/html/ti154stack/example-applications.html) \
section of the TI15.4-Stack User's Guide.

Value | Description
--- | ---
Beacon | Beacon-enabled mode of network operation where coordinator device \
transmits periodic beacons to indicate its presence. For more information, \
refer to the [Beacon Mode](/ti154stack/html/ti154stack/beacon-mode.html) \
section of the TI15.4-Stack User's Guide.
Non Beacon | Non beacon-enabled mode of network operation where coordinator \
does not send out periodic beacons. For more information, refer to the \
[Non Beacon Mode](/ti154stack/html/ti154stack/non-beacon-mode.html) section of \
the TI15.4-Stack User's Guide.
Frequency Hopping | Frequency hopping mode of network operation where network \
devices hop on different frequencies. For more information, refer to the \
[Frequency Hopping Mode](/ti154stack/html/ti154stack/\
frequency-hopping-mode.html) section of the TI15.4-Stack User's Guide.
