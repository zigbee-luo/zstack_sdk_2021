    description: "Configures transmit power in dBm",
    longDescription: `
Configures the transmit power in dBm. When the nodes in the network are close \
to each other, lowering this value helps reduce saturation.
\n\
For more information regarding transmit power levels supported by each board,\
 please refer to the \
[TX Power](/proprietary-rf/proprietary-rf-users-guide/proprietary-rf/\
tx-power.html) section of the RF User's Guide and the \
[CC1352P1 and CC1352P2 Support](/ti154stack/html/ti154stack/\
configuring-stack.html#cc1352p1-and-cc1352p2-support) section of the \
TI15.4-Stack User's Guide.

__Default__: 0

__Range__: Supported TX power levels vary by board and band

const rxOnIdle = {
    description: "Selects whether a device is sleepy or not",
    longDescription: `
Selects whether a device operates as a sleepy or nonsleepy node, and \
thus has RX on while idle: false for sleepy, and true for nonsleepy. \
Note that beacon mode will increase current due to beacon events if \
the device is sleepy.
\n\
__Default__: False (unchecked)
