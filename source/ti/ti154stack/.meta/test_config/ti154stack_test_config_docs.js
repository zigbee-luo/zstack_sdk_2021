const powerTestEnable = {
    description: "Enables power testing mode",

Enables power settings including data ramp sizes and power profile settings.

const certificationTestMode = {
    description: `Enables certification mode for FCC or ETSI compliance \
testing`,
    longDescription: `
If set to true, the device joins the collector and transmits back-to-back \
frames to it. The collector does not generate any frames, but simply \
acknowledges the transmissions from the sensor. The frames can be captured \
using a spectrum analyzer to perform the channel occupancy test.
\n\
The mode can also be used for ETSI testing. The example application is only \
provided for a general guidance and for ease in performing regulation tests.
\n\
__Note__: The FH conformance certification example application is provided to \
allow users to perform a FCC or ETSI compliance tests related to channel
occupancy.
\n\

ti154stack/example-applications.html#configuration-parameters) and the \
[FH Conformance Certification Application Example](/ti154stack/html/ti154stack/\

--- | ---
Polling Only | Polling only
Data and ACK | Application data and ACK is sent from the sensor to collector
Poll and Data | Poll and received data from the collector
Sleep | No poll or data.  Note that beacon mode will increase current due to \
beacon events if  the device is sleepy.
