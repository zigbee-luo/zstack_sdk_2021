Value | Description
--- | ---
Disabled | No encryption enabled
MAC Security | The TI 15.4-Stack supports AES encryption as defined by the \
IEEE 802.15.4 Specification. For more information, refer to the \
[Security](/ti154stack/html/ti154stack/configuring-stack.html#security) \
section of the TI15.4-Stack User's Guide.
MAC Security & Commissioning | Secure device commissioning in addition to AES \
encryption. For more information, refer to the \
[Secure Commissioning](/ti154stack/html/ti154stack/secure-commissioning.html) \
section of the TI15.4-Stack User's Guide.
