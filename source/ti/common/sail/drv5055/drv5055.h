 *  @brief      DRV5055 Automotive Ratiometric Linear Hall Effect Sensor
 *
 *  The DRV5055-Q1 is a linear Hall effect sensor that responds proportionally
 *  to magnetic flux density. It can be used for accurate position sensing in
 *  a wide range of applications.
 *
 *  The DRV5055 header file should be included in an application as
 *  follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/common/sail/drv5055/drv5055.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Operation
 *  The DRV5055 driver simplifies using a DRV5055 sensor to perform magnetic
 *  flux readings. The DRV5055 sensor's output is analog with voltage ranging
 *  from 0 to Vcc. With zero magnetic flux, the sensor's output is Vcc/2. A
 *  value less than Vcc/2 indicates north pole shift and value greater than Vcc/2
 *  indicate south pole shift. The DRV5055 driver routes the analog output to
 *  ADC and converts its value to magnetic flux with in the range of the sensor.
 *
 *  The API in this driver serve as an interface to a DPL(Driver Porting Layer)
 *  The specific implementations are responsible for creating all the RTOS
 *  specific primitives to allow for thread-safe operation.
 *
 *  This driver has no dynamic memory allocation.
